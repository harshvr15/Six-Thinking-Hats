# Six-Thinking-Hats
This research work looks at the use of Six Thinking Hats in the Problem-Solving domain. It first introduces Six Thinking Hats; how it works and how to use it. Following that two papers have been reviewed that use this technique. The first paper, Charles Kivunja (2015), looks at the use of this technique in the context of achieving success in the 21st-century economy. The second paper, Sreeramana Aithal (2017), looks at another use of this technique in the context of six different approaches to analyze a given problem and how can one reach an ideal solution. Following these papers an experiment undertaken by me is detailed, explaining the context in which it was used, how it was used, what results were achieved, and some reflections on the process.
